Task
Develop Rectangle and ArrayRectangles with a predefined functionality.

On a Common level it is obligatory:
To develop Rectangle class with following content:
• 2 closed real fields sideA and sideB (sides А and В of the rectangle)
• Constructor with two real parameters a and b (parameters specify rectangle
sides)
• Constructor with a real parameter a (parameter specify side А of a rectangle,
side B is always equal to 5)
• Constructor without parameters (side А of a rectangle equals to 4, side В - 3)
• Method GetSideA, returning value of the side А
• Method GetSideВ, returning value of the side В
• Method Area, calculating and returning the area value
• Method Perimeter, calculating and returning the perimeter value
• Method IsSquare, checking whether current rectangle is shape square or not.
Returns true if the shape is square and false in another case.
• Method ReplaceSides, swapping rectangle sides

On an Advanced level also needed:

Develop class ArrayRectangles, in which declare:
• Private field rectangle_array - array of rectangles
• Constructor creating an empty array of rectangles with length n
• Constructor that receives an arbitrary amount of objects of type Rectangle or
an array of objects of type Rectangle.
• Method AddRectangle that adds a rectangle of type Rectangle to the array
on the nearest free place and returning true, or returning false, if there is no
free space in the array
• Method NumberMaxArea, that returns order number (index) of the rectangle
with the maximum area value (numeration starts from zero)
• Method NumberMinPerimeter, that returns order number(index) of the
rectangle with the minimum area value (numeration starts from zero)
• Method NumberSquare, that returns the number of squares in the array of
rectangles
